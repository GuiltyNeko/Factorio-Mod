circuit-updates=Bob electronics compat fixes

fived-loaders=Updates to the loader tech

[mod-setting-description]
circuit-updates=This setting controls whether or not my mod will update some other mods recipes that use "electronic-circuit" to use "basic-circuit" if and only if bob's electronics is present. This is to fix issues in mods such as hacked splitters where they don't update to the basic boards when the normal ones do.

fived-loaders=Changes the first loader tech to only use red science packs.
