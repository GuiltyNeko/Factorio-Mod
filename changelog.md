1.0.9	-Added support for 5dim's loaders; this update removes green science packs from the yellow loader. Later I plan to remove the highest tier pack from each other loader tech, to make it more linear.
1.0.10	-Moved the "blah.lua" file to the prototypes folder. Did this after looking at bob's assembly mod and seeing how they did it, and therefore understanding how it properly works.
1.0.11	-Removed the electric furnace from the "Advanced material processing 2" tech. Next up: changing the recipe.
1.0.12  -Removed optional 5dim's dependency and restructured mod for better operations.
1.0.13  -Changed electric furnace recipe to require electronic circuits instead of advanced circuits.
1.0.14  -Tentative tweaks for bob's electronics compatability with hacked splitters and burner-filter-inserter. These mods don't automatically change recipe when bob's electronics is present, and as such, are expensive to use and fairly impractical at the very start.
