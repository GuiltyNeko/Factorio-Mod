[mod-setting-description]
everything=Turns on every feature in the mod, except for the electric furnace changes. Because it completely overwrites the recipe, it isn't completely compatible with any changes another mod might make.

circuit-updates=This setting controls whether or not my mod will update some other mods recipes that use "electronic-circuit" to use "basic-circuit" if and only if bob's electronics is present. This is to fix issues in mods such as hacked splitters where they don't update to the basic boards when the normal ones do.

circuit-network=Removes the green science packs from the circuit network tech.

fived-loaders=Changes the first loader tech (from 5dim's automization mod) to only use red science packs.

loadertech=Moves the unlock tech for 5dim's loader. It keeps the tech in the same spot, so there's no worries about compatability.

beltsorter=Moves the first belt sorter to the logistics tech. Because it's a logistical thing. Makes sense to me.

electric-furnace-tech=This setting moves the electric furnace to the logistics tech, so it can be unlocked much earlier in the game.

electric-furnace-recipe=Enables the recipe change for the electric furnace to use green circuits instead of red ones.

landfill=Removes the green science pack cost from the landfill tech.
